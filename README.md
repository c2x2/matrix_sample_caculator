# introduction
This is my first git respository.I create a program to calculate some easy matrix.
There may be many errors and hope my three great borthers can give me some special advice.
# SOME PROBLEMS
Because of the initial error,the caculator can only be used on the int number.We can only output the double type when getting the inverse.
# ADD
I make some corrections.Now,we can use the inverse() to get the inverse of a matrix.The type of elements of matrix is changed into double.The old problems are mostly sovled.And we now can use >> to get the ouput.
# weclome to my first git respository
hope you can get some help from this.and hope you can give me some advice.
