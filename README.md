# test1
This is my first git respository.I create a program to calculate some easy matrix.
There may be many errors and hope my three great borthers can give me some special advice.

# SOME PROBLEMS
Because of the initial error,the caculator can only be used on the int number.We can only output the double type when getting the inverse.
# Attention!
When you want to get the inverse,you should use the function inves(matrix mat) rather the matrix.inverse().The problem is caused by the low level.Hope my brothers can accept my apology.
ADD
I make some corrections.Now,we can use the inverse() to get the inverse of a matrix.The type of elements of matrix is changed into double.The old problems are mostly sovled.And we now can use >> to get the ouput.
